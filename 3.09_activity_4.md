# 3.09 Activity 4

1. Create a Python function named `get_daily_transactions()` (taking the engine as input) to query the Bank database to obtain the number of daily transactions. The dataframe must contain the following columns: 

   - `Date `(%Y-%m-%d format). Hint: use MySQL functions `convert()`, and `date_format()`.
   CAVEAT!!! Use `%%Y-%%m-%%d` as the date format **in the Python function** otherwise you will get a format error because Python will understand a single `%` as a Python format string instead of the MySQL format string. Test first your query in MySQL
   - `Day_of_week`, which will contain (Monday, Tuesday,...). Hint: use `dayofweek()` and `case when` functions.
   - `Trans` shows the total number of transactions.

   and add the function to the `functions.py` file.

2. Modify the `eda.py` file to add a line plot made with [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/) displaying the number of daily transactions.
